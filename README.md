# SimplixOS-Popcorn
The official SimplixOS repository. The Popcorn Kernel is located inside the folder kernel.
# SimplixOS
SimplixOS is an Unix-like operating system. It's a hobby operating system, it's not made to be a widespread OS like Windows.
# Popcorn
Popcorn is an Unix-like kernel, it powers the SimplixOS operating system. It doesn't rely on Linux or other Unix-based kernel.
# External sources
https://osdev.org/ was an useful website to help develop the kernel, as well as https://codeproject.com/
# Liscence
I am (EscapeCharacter) a supporter for the free software mouvement. So almost all of my code is published under some kind of Free software liscence, 
mostly GPL3. Both SimplixOS and Popcorn are completly open-source and free software. Both follow the "free speech" and "free beer", but if you want 
your new SimplixOS distribution can cost money or be private source. I have no problem with that.
